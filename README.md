# XFunctions
Extended Function Combinators

This is a very simple Racket lib that I wrote for myself and use quite
a bit more than I probably should. I'm sharing it now so I can include
it for other, more interesting things that I'll share later.

You can install it pretty simply.

Via that Racket package index:
```sh
$ raco pkg install xfunctions
```

Directly from github:
```sh
$ raco pkg install https://github.com/wesleybits/xfunctions
```

More details are available in documentation:
```sh
$ raco doc xfunctions
```
